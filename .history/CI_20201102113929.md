# Continuous integration with Powerbuilder

To fully configure a continuous integration tool for Powerbuilder with basic function like: code update on commit which include pbls generation, unit tests running and report and executable generation, you need to follow serveral steps. Here I will indicate each steps and discuss possible problem or wolkaround needed to make it work. The use case will be a simple Powerbuilder project with Jinkins CI tool.  

## Requirement

To follow along this documentation,  you need to have the following setup in your machine :monkey_face: :

- The powerbuilder IDE: I'm using the Powerbuilder 2017 version
- Jenkins CI tool
- Jenkins PBC pluggin file from [here](https://github.com/bruce-armstrong/pbc_compile-plugin-2019.git)
- Jenkins Orcascript pluggin form [here](https://github.com/bruce-armstrong/orcascript-plugin-2019.git)
- PBUnit: there are two repositories on github. I will suggest to dowload the one on github [here](https://github.com/mahugnon/PowerUnitHonore.git) which is  a reorganised version of [marivard/powerunit](https://github.com/marivard/powerunit.git)

With this we're ready to go.

## Intallation of Jinkins pluggins

Once you install Jinkins, run it and go to :ok_hand:  :grin:.
